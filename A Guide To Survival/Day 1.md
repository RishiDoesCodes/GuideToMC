So, You create a new survival world and start fresh, then what do you do? Well this is gonna tell just that

# Day 1

Well, first of all you should always get wood. There are 6 types of wood on the overworld.

# Crafting Table

The crafting table as the name suggests is used to craft stuff. The crafting table is a 3x3 grid whereas your inventory grid is a 2x2. 

Now that you have made a crafting table, make a wooden pickaxe using wooden planks(x3) and sticks(x2)

and mine stone. You may realise that the stone turns into cobblestone. Using the cobble stone and sticks craft a set of stone tools. This includes

# Health and Hunger

![Health and Hunger](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTJ-wKs5kcMs2vYalbQoKMNt9L29gZTAeeNOg&usqp=CAU)

Now you may notice 10 hearts and food icons on the top left and right of your screen (or above your hotbar)

These display how much health and hunger you have.

If you have no health, you will die. You can heal your health by eating.

If the hunger bar is full you will heal, if its not you wont be able to heal. If you hunger bar has less than 3 hunger you will not be able to sprint

To get food, you need to kill animals like pigs, cows, chickens and sheeps (you may get wool from sheeps, it will come useful when making a bed). But eating it raw wont heal much of your hunger bar.

You need to cook it using a furnace. You can craft a furnace by making a ring of cobblestone(x8) in a crafting table.

![Furnace Recipe](https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2020/12/10b0f-16088938860601-800.jpg)

You can cook your food by placing the food on top, and fuel below it. You can use wood, coal or charcoal as fuel.

# Nighttime

You may realise that the world has become a bit darker. That is not good as during the night, mobs like zombies, skeletons and creepers start to spawn. To skip the night, you need a bed. Craft a bed by using wool from sheeps and wooden planks

![Bed Recipe](https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2021/01/23ae0-16097373557660-800.jpg)
